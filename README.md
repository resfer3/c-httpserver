# c-httpserver
A basic http server.

Some network programming, some multithreading, really fun to hit these really fundamentals points and experiment a little.
I could add support for running code to generate dynamic content, but that's for later. I'll come back to add that feature in the feature.
I completed the project, which is a basic web server that serves html documents that's good for now. NOW! to move on to greater things.

### Notes
netstat -tulpn
kill <pid>

ALSOOOO! I found a substitute for gdb in mac, LLDB. It's a fully featured debugger, with no need of debugging flags in compilation.
When breakpoint is met, it outputs a little snippet of that code. REALLY HELPFUL!
