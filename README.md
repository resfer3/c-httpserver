# c-httpserver
A basic http server.

After this project, the idea is to use this server to use for my own terminal-chat all built in c.

netstat -tulpn
kill <pid>

ALSOOOO! I found a substitute for gdb in mac, LLDB. It's a fully featured debugger, with no need of debugging flags in compilation.
When breakpoint is met, it outputs a little snippet of that code. REALLY HELPFUL!
